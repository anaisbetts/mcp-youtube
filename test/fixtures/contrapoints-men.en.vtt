00:00:01.689 --> 00:00:04.189
(eerie music)

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:09.260
- Hi boys, it's me again,
just your average girl.

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:10.970
Look I may be a biological female,

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:13.510
but I do hope that just for this video,

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:15.933
we're able to converse as men.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.620
I want you to think back to 2016

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.150
which I know in internet years

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.080
is like halfway between now
and the decline of Rome.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.370
Do you like history, boys?

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:25.810
How did Rome fall again?

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.630
Was it the gays?

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.130
Tell me all about it.

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.790
Back in 2016 the big internet culture war

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:33.900
was between feminists on one side

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.010
and men's rights activists on the other.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:37.350
What ever happened to that?

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.350
These days it's as dead a
meme as I don't know, Harambe.

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:44.050
I did want to do the fedora though.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.560
Every YouTuber who's ever covered

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.270
the men's rights movement
has done the fedora

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.410
and I wanted to put my
own little twist on it.

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.030
My wardrobe notes for this
video say "MRA femme fatale"

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.400
and "fedora but make it fashion."

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.770
School shooter realness.

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.620
I feel like I'm also serving a little

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.520
red-pilled Carmen Sandiego?

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.983
In this video I wanna
ask, in all seriousness,

00:01:05.983 --> 00:01:08.440
what are we going to do about men?

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.969
Because, no offense, but, as a group,

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:16.090
you guys kind of seem like
you're not doing okay.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:17.950
Could a group of people who are purchasing

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.221
uncucked alpha yogurt
possibly be subsisting

00:01:20.221 --> 00:01:22.660
in a state of psychological balance?

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.170
Fellas, are regular bowel movements gay?

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:27.347
I guess yeah, kind of.

00:01:27.347 --> 00:01:29.390
You don't see a whole lot of psyllium husk

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.275
in heterosexual medicine cabinets.

00:01:31.275 --> 00:01:32.970
I'm losing my target audience here.

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.350
Listen my dudes, let's just say

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:36.970
I'm kinda worried about you guys.

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.710
And I'm not saying I'm any better.

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.040
To be clear, I'm not okay either.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.888
There's like 15 jars of urine
in my refrigerator right now.

00:01:43.888 --> 00:01:45.500
Yeah, that's right.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.495
Women pee too, okay?

00:01:46.495 --> 00:01:47.810
Get over it.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.120
I'm so sorry if this
offends your male notions

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.630
of feminine delicacy, but I
for one will not be shamed

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.775
by your patriarchal bullshit.

00:01:55.775 --> 00:01:57.108
[dramatic music]

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.247
You boys, you're very
rational, aren't you?

00:02:02.247 --> 00:02:03.800
(scoffs) 
I suppose I was too.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.168
I admit that these days rationality,

00:02:06.168 --> 00:02:07.819
it's something I struggle with,

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:11.350
both as a biological female
and as a Pisces moon.

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:12.480
But when I decided I wanted

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.730
to make a video for men,
ContraPoints For Him

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.599
I started brushing up on
my reasoning skills because

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.135
I wanna be so

00:02:20.135 --> 00:02:22.900
f*cking rational for you.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.060
So to prepare for this video

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.700
I read Newton's "Principia Mathematica",

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.760
Wittgenstein's "Tractatus
Logico-Philosophicus",

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.820
and of course the philosophical classic,

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.290
"The Rational Male" by Rollo Caliente.

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.424
So my mind is
well-lubricated and I'm ready

00:02:35.424 --> 00:02:37.050
for what I have no doubt

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.930
will be a penetrating intellectual

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:42.620
interchange.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.880
Look, I wanna play by your rules, okay?

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.660
So there will be no
emotions in this video.

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.560
I will present my arguments
in strict logical form,

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.020
relying only on facts, reason, evidence,

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.458
and deductive proof.

00:02:55.458 --> 00:02:58.445
(Grindr notification)

00:02:58.445 --> 00:03:00.061
(typing)

00:03:00.061 --> 00:03:00.894
(Grindr notification)

00:03:00.894 --> 00:03:02.802
(Grindr notification)

00:03:02.802 --> 00:03:04.003
(typing)

00:03:04.003 --> 00:03:04.836
(Grindr notification)

00:03:04.836 --> 00:03:05.669
Actually, you know what?

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.180
F*ck that.

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.149
Let's listen to house
music and do sex drugs!

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:13.816
(upbeat music)

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.770
I'm pandering to the male gaze!

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:32.640
Oh, and the male straights.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:33.850
God I love attention!

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:34.840
Hey gorg.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.100
Hey gorg.

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.940
Hey gooooorg.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.153
Okay, I'm ready.

00:03:39.153 --> 00:03:40.933
Let's crack open a cold one boys.

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.230
My hands are too pretty to open the can.

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.200
I need a man to do it for me.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.033
Help.

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:50.954
Fuck it.

00:03:50.954 --> 00:03:53.070
(cork pops)

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:54.222
Okay, that's super great.

00:03:54.222 --> 00:03:55.055
Hey gorg.

00:03:55.055 --> 00:03:55.888
Hey gorg.

00:03:55.888 --> 00:03:57.950
If there are any women
still watching this video,

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:59.333
I'm really sorry about all this.

00:03:59.333 --> 00:04:01.930
Unless you're into that sort of thing,

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.630
in which case how very dare.

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.140
I'm a good Presbyterian.

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.200
And by Presbyterian I do mean pansexual  heyhowareyou.

00:04:08.243 --> 00:04:09.420
Look the video's about men

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.615
so I'm trying to be attractive to men.

00:04:11.615 --> 00:04:13.460
Am I doing this right?

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:14.620
Is this what men like?

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:15.853
Trap straps!

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.460
It is a risky look for a girl like me.

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:19.740
When you do a lingerie look you know

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:21.160
you're gonna wind up somewhere on the

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.572
Frank-N-Furter/Violet
Chachki/Dita von Teese spectrum,

00:04:23.572 --> 00:04:26.260
oh but you don't know where exactly.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.990
And that is a dangerous game ladies.

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.001
I have to say though I actually am feeling

00:04:31.001 --> 00:04:34.230
pretty f*cking empowered right, but um

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.740
that could be because of the drugs.

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.300
Look, gentlemen,

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.820
let's be rational.

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.490
No more fooling around, okay?

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.674
Part one, oh wait.

00:04:44.674 --> 00:04:46.560
Rational.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.310
Axiom one, America's Next Top Victim

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.870
I think there is some truth to the idea

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.430
that we live in a victimhood culture.

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.780
And I'm not just talking about campus SJWs

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.330
with their microaggressions.

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.640
No bitch, this goes
all the way to the top.

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.920
We have white people whining
about reverse racism.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.700
We have the literal 1%

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:12.200
complaining about "anti-rich prejudice"

00:05:12.288 --> 00:05:15.140
That must be super f*cking hard for you.

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:16.950
We have the heterosexual agenda

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.260
organizing straight pride parades.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.240
You know, flaunting their sexuality

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.890
in the faces of children who
are trying raise a family

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:26.091
and protesting in the street
like a bunch of (beep).

00:05:26.091 --> 00:05:28.830
And so of course because
there was women's rights

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.790
there has to be men's rights too.

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:32.180
I've been hearing about men's rights

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:33.460
for my whole adult life,

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.550
and I've always been very skeptical.

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:36.850
Because in my experience,

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:39.220
online men's rights activism in practice

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:40.720
always looks like this.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.498
Women try to do a good thing
to solve a real problem

00:05:43.498 --> 00:05:47.290
and then a man shows up to
say, "Well what about men?

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:48.770
"Men also get harassed.

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:50.790
"Why aren't you talking about men?"

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:53.520
And is this man actually
involved in activism

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.330
to stop harassment against men?

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.490
Of course he's fucking not.

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:59.080
He doesn't give a shit.

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.260
He's a troll.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.770
His contribution to the
conversation begins and ends

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:05.310
with, "What about men?"

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:06.550
What about them, honey?

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:07.630
For this video I decided

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:09.420
to actually do some research for once,

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:11.860
and the first thing I did was
read the foundational text

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.560
of the modern men's rights movement,

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.160
which is "The Myth of Male
Power" by Warren Farrell.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.800
Actually I listened to the audiobook

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.490
'cause let's be honest, reading is hard.

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:23.670
But as I was listening, I admit
I thought it made more sense

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:25.030
than I was expecting it to.

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:27.710
Basically, Farrell says
that second-wave feminists

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:30.000
rightly fought against the
traditional gender role

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.170
that confined women to domestic servitude.

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:34.280
But, he argues that the feminist idea

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.380
that men have all the power in society

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:37.840
is actually an illusion,

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.140
because the traditional
gender role for men

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:41.530
is just as oppressive.

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:44.330
He introduces the idea
of male disposability,

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:47.990
basically the idea that
society values female lives

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:50.830
more than male lives, which
are seen as expendable

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:52.840
in the service of protecting and providing

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:54.130
for women and children.

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:55.810
And he points to statistics showing

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:58.680
that men make up the majority
of military casualties,

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.401
workplace fatalities, murder
victims, suicides, and so on.

00:07:01.401 --> 00:07:03.610
So we're supposed to conclude

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:05.930
that even though at
first it looks like men

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:07.430
have more power than women,

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:11.270
in fact the queens have a
certain kind of privilege

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:13.550
in being protected and provided for

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:16.110
by the expendable male worker bees.

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:18.370
And I guess that kinda makes sense.

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:20.824
I feel like I can at least
empathize with the point of view.

00:07:20.824 --> 00:07:23.712
What I'm saying is, I took the red pill.

00:07:23.712 --> 00:07:25.580
And I rubbed it on my cliiiiiiit.

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.380
But some initial objections come to mind.

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:32.310
Like, haven't men been almost all

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:35.280
of the kings, presidents,
and CEOs for millennia?

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:37.910
Didn't men make up all these
rules in the first place?

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:38.840
I don't know, boys.

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:41.480
Still seems kinda patriarchal to me.

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:44.810
But maybe you'll say that it's
only at the top of society

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:47.110
that men have more power than women.

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:50.530
Maybe the average man is also oppressed

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:53.260
by this system that
feminists call patriarchy.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:54.570
If that's what you're saying

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:57.810
I think I basically agree with that.

00:07:57.810 --> 00:07:58.976
See, what you have to understand about me

00:07:58.976 --> 00:08:00.720
is I am such

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:02.350
a f*cking Libra.

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:04.950
Whenever there's a conflict
my gut reaction is to be like,

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:06.292
well, maybe everybody's right.

00:08:06.292 --> 00:08:08.830
And maybe there's good
points on both sides

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:10.500
and we should all just
listen to each other

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:14.143
and rub each others cliiiiiiits.

00:08:14.143 --> 00:08:16.563
But no, my Scorpio-rising
persona will not allow that.

00:08:16.563 --> 00:08:18.756
Oh, there will be a champion,

00:08:18.756 --> 00:08:20.700
there will be blood.

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:22.930
So, judges,

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:24.680
how do we decide which gender

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:26.490
is America's next top victim?

00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:29.600
I mean it's not like you
can just change genders

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:31.250
and see how the other half lives.

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:33.048
Or can you?

00:08:33.048 --> 00:08:33.881
(dramatic music)

00:08:33.881 --> 00:08:37.582
Proposition two, Diary of an Ex-Man.

00:08:37.582 --> 00:08:41.440
- (V.O.) Dear diary, with every
false smile I conceal

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:44.233
that on the inside I'm
drowning in darkness!

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:46.780
- Mom!

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:48.370
Get out of my room.

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:49.610
Ugh, You're ruining my life!

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:54.040
Look. I've never, ever talked
about this on my channel before

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:57.190
so this is like a super f*cking
vulnerable moment for me,

00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:59.090
but I was born a boy.

00:08:59.090 --> 00:09:01.436
Well, was I ever really a boy?

00:09:01.436 --> 00:09:02.717
It's hard to say.

00:09:02.717 --> 00:09:05.810
- (V.O.) Dear diary, growing up I always knew

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:09.570
that I was different from other
kids, especially other boys.

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:13.069
And it took me so long to
pinpoint what it was, but

00:09:13.069 --> 00:09:15.600
there was this moment.

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:18.370
I must have been what,
seven, eight years old?

00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:21.410
And I was playing in my
parents' room all by myself,

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:25.840
and I saw this pair of my
mom's shoes lying on the floor

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:27.530
and I don't know what it was.

00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:30.940
It was like this magnetism
that drew me to them,

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:32.650
and I put my little feet in them

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:34.827
and walked in front of the mirror and

00:09:34.827 --> 00:09:37.060
I didn't really have the words yet

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:38.560
to describe how I felt,

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:42.130
but basically in that moment I sensed

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:43.830
that God had made a mistake

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:47.850
and I was destined to be,

00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:49.193
to be a crossdresser.

00:09:51.013 --> 00:09:53.510
- That is super f*cking coconuts.

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:56.160
Anyway then in my 20s my
life completely fell apart

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:56.993
and I became a woman.

00:09:56.993 --> 00:09:57.880
Hey, how are you?

00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:59.870
I became one of... 
(chimes) the dolls.

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:01.560
My plastic surgeon is an artist.

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.617
Look, boys, the point I'm
trying to make here is

00:10:03.617 --> 00:10:06.070
I used to live your lifestyle.

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:07.510
I know what people like you get up to

00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:09.380
and I think it's disgusting.

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:11.416
I gotta say though, since I transitioned,

00:10:11.416 --> 00:10:13.420
my life has been super f*cking great.

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:14.790
Like, way better.

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:15.700
Now of course a lot of that

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:17.590
is not because women
have it better than men,

00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:22.448
but because, hey gorg, I
am literally transgendered!

00:10:22.448 --> 00:10:25.520
So before I transitioned
I was dying inside.

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:26.986
You know, I was in the wrong body.

00:10:26.986 --> 00:10:30.900
And now (sighs) it's like
I finally have the body

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:32.710
I was meant to die inside of!

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:34.020
But it's not just that.

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:36.020
I do think that, in some ways,

00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:37.730
since I started presenting as a woman,

00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:39.810
people actually do treat me better.

00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:42.410
I mean, they take my
opinions less seriously sure,

00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:44.935
but that's probably for the best.

00:10:44.935 --> 00:10:47.060
Now before using my personal experience

00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:48.380
as any kind of evidence,

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:50.400
I guess I should say a couple caveats.

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:53.880
Caveat one is that most
pre-transition trans women

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:56.750
are not like other boys and
most of us were not living

00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:59.960
the business-class male
experience by any means.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:02.210
You know, it's a lot
of drunk melancholics,

00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:05.329
tormented sissies,
secretive transvestites,

00:11:05.329 --> 00:11:07.890
poets, you know,

00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:09.460
that sort of thing.

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:12.442
Caveat two is that MY trans experience

00:11:12.442 --> 00:11:14.910
is not THE trans experience,

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:16.750
and I do have a lot of other privileges

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:20.000
that made things go super
f*cking well for me heyhowreyou.

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:22.890
Don't you just love it when
someone checks their privilege

00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:25.570
in a way that's actually just bragging?

00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:27.160
You know it's super important for me

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:29.580
to acknowledge that
I've been so successful

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:30.676
and I've come so far

00:11:30.676 --> 00:11:34.900
in part because I'm white
and I'm skinny and I'm young

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:37.980
and I'm blonde and I'm rich and I pass

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:40.181
and I'm educated and I'm popular

00:11:40.181 --> 00:11:42.132
and my plastic surgeon is an artist

00:11:42.132 --> 00:11:43.920
and my boyfriend is really rich and hot

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:46.610
and I come from a pure Aryan bloodline.

00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:47.490
And part of what makes me

00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:49.760
so enlightened and so compassionate

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:52.550
is that I'm able to
recognize these privileges

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:55.330
that I have that just
might not be available

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:58.554
to people who are less fortunate.

00:11:58.554 --> 00:11:59.507
From the bottom of my motherf*cking

00:11:59.507 --> 00:12:00.920
and my fatherf*cking heart

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:02.390
that must be super f*cking hard for you.

00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:03.643
I can't even imagine.

00:12:04.533 --> 00:12:06.270
What I was saying is there are ways

00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:07.560
that people treat me better now

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.010
that I'm presenting as a woman.

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:10.880
You know, people smile at me more.

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:12.680
I feel more taken care of.

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:14.368
Men do things for me!

00:12:14.368 --> 00:12:17.570
Now a lot of women don't like
men doing things for them.

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:19.773
You know, holding doors,
helping with luggage

00:12:19.773 --> 00:12:22.994
because they feel that it's
infantalizing or condescending.

00:12:22.994 --> 00:12:24.770
But not me.

00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:27.700
I love it, both because I love attention

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:30.050
and because I am a recumbent queen

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:31.626
who's too much of a delicate
flower to lift a finger.

00:12:31.626 --> 00:12:34.560
I do this thing on airplanes
where when it's time for me

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:36.787
to put my carry-on luggage
in the overhead bin,

00:12:36.787 --> 00:12:39.195
I pretend that my bag is
too heavy for me to lift,

00:12:39.195 --> 00:12:43.410
and then some man will usually
get up and do it for me,

00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:45.370
even though I'm taller than most men.

00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:46.600
It makes me happy!

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:48.210
Another good thing about becoming a woman

00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:50.980
is I integrated more into
female social groups,

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:54.020
and I found that they provide
a kind of communal support

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:55.340
and overt affection

00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:58.690
that male social groups
generally just don't.

00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:00.750
I find the female social
style suits me better

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:03.540
than the male one, which
tends to be more atomized,

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:06.870
more individualist, where
affection is always concealed

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:10.050
behind this semi-jokey
front of competition.

00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:12.340
Like think about the way
boys talk to each other

00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:13.760
when they're playing video games.

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:15.410
A third improvement for
me has to do with the way

00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:18.000
men and women are treated
differently in public space.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.860
When you present female in public

00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:22.390
you're more likely to be
treated as a spectacle

00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:23.510
to be commented upon.

00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:27.130
People, usually men, will just blurt out

00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:28.550
their opinions about you,

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:30.684
sometimes complimentary,
sometimes insulting,

00:13:30.684 --> 00:13:33.400
sometimes just f*cking weird.

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:34.970
Whereas when you present male in public

00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:36.970
you're more likely to be treated

00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:39.149
either as invisible or as dangerous.

00:13:39.149 --> 00:13:40.860
Now feminists have traditionally

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:41.896
interpreted these differences

00:13:41.896 --> 00:13:45.960
as men asserting dominance
over women in public space,

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:47.480
and they've criticized catcalling

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:50.400
as being objectifying,
degrading, and misogynistic.

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.179
And it certainly can
be all of those things.

00:13:52.179 --> 00:13:54.350
But there's different kinds of catcalling,

00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:56.240
and I have different feelings about them.

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:57.796
If I'm walking with another woman

00:13:57.796 --> 00:14:00.932
and a man says, "Ladies,
you look beautiful tonight,"

00:14:00.932 --> 00:14:03.400
I don't know, I like that.

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:04.740
I think that's nice.

00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:05.840
It makes me feel seen.

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:07.010
It makes me feel admired.

00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:08.760
It boosts my confidence.

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:10.744
Whereas, if I'm walking alone

00:14:10.744 --> 00:14:14.447
and a drunk starts following
me down the street singing,

00:14:14.447 --> 00:14:17.287
"Have you seen Polythene Pam?

00:14:17.287 --> 00:14:19.957
"She's so good looking,
but she looks like a man!"

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:24.170
That I am less enthusiastic about.

00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:25.680
I mean not that that's ever happened.

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:28.700
I'm completely f*cking unclockable heyhowreyou...

00:14:28.723 --> 00:14:32.074
♪ No one knows what it's like ♪

00:14:32.074 --> 00:14:35.150
♪ To be a sad tran ♪

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:36.890
I definitely get where
feminists are coming from

00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:38.700
because street harassment sucks.

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:40.600
I'm a lot more afraid
walking alone at night

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:42.918
than I used to be, and
there's a lot more places

00:14:42.918 --> 00:14:44.785
I just won't go by myself.

00:14:44.785 --> 00:14:46.015
But on the other hand,

00:14:46.015 --> 00:14:48.945
I do now enjoy being able to
walk down the street at night

00:14:48.945 --> 00:14:52.180
without other people acting afraid of me.

00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:55.300
I think a lot of feminists
have failed to imagine the ways

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:57.668
that being treated as
invisible or dangerous

00:14:57.668 --> 00:15:00.410
can also kind of suck.

00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:01.750
In my video on incels

00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:04.800
I talked about male
invisibility on dating apps

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:06.664
and how getting no attention at all

00:15:06.664 --> 00:15:09.100
can actually be emotionally worse

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:10.920
than getting a lot of sh*tty attention.

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:13.654
And when it comes to being
treated as dangerous,

00:15:13.654 --> 00:15:15.309
when I was living as a man

00:15:15.309 --> 00:15:17.664
sometimes if I was walking at night,

00:15:17.664 --> 00:15:19.980
a woman on the same block as me

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:21.930
would change sides of the street.

00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:23.450
And I totally get why.

00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:26.229
Men do scary shit sometimes,
and it's better to be safe.

00:15:26.229 --> 00:15:28.760
But it still stung a little bit

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:31.810
to be treated as dangerous by default.

00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:33.520
I think it can actually be harmful,

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:36.520
which becomes clearer if we
add race into the equation.

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:38.810
There's ways that white women's fear

00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:42.270
can actually be dangerous
in particular to black men.

00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:43.830
I had an experience with this recently

00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:45.720
when I was filming my
video "The Apocalypse"

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:48.120
and I'd rented a room in a hotel casino.

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:50.300
Around midnight I was
carrying some camera equipment

00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:52.520
up to my room, and I got into the elevator

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:54.610
with a group of people
from the casino floor.

00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:57.190
A couple floors up, everyone
got out of the elevator

00:15:57.190 --> 00:16:00.130
except for me and a single black man.

00:16:00.130 --> 00:16:01.735
Well, I mean he was alone,

00:16:01.735 --> 00:16:03.300
but I don't know if he was single.

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:04.133
That's not part of the story.

00:16:04.133 --> 00:16:05.540
And as soon as the door closed

00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:08.657
he started literally whistling
Row, Row, Row Your Boat,

00:16:08.657 --> 00:16:11.670
the official melody of
performative innocence.

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:15.847
And I realized oh sh*t,
he's afraid that I'm afraid.

00:16:15.847 --> 00:16:18.020
And I found that just excruciating.

00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:19.971
I was like oh God.

00:16:19.971 --> 00:16:22.571
How do other white women
behave in elevators?

00:16:22.571 --> 00:16:25.543
Do they like, clutch their purses?

00:16:26.549 --> 00:16:27.410
(groans)

00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:29.132
That's so f*cking embarrassing.

00:16:29.132 --> 00:16:31.680
Nothing like that had ever happened to me

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:32.913
when I was living as a man.

00:16:32.913 --> 00:16:35.600
It's not a thing between
black men and white men.

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:38.320
It's a thing between
black men and white women.

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:39.820
And so that dynamic was there

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:42.180
not just because I'm white and he's black,

00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:44.950
but because I'm a woman and he's a man.

00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:46.720
And I thought of that incident again

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:48.920
when I was listening to
"The Myth of Male Power"

00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:50.961
and Farrell says, "Men's greatest weakness

00:16:50.961 --> 00:16:53.157
"is their facade of strength,

00:16:53.157 --> 00:16:54.987
"and women's greatest strength

00:16:54.987 --> 00:16:56.710
"is their facade of weakness."

00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:58.780
I think there is some truth to the idea

00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:00.640
that women's perceived vulnerability

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:01.707
can make them powerful,

00:17:01.707 --> 00:17:05.020
and men's perceived power
can make them vulnerable.

00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:06.970
Now I hope you're taking all
of this with a grain of salt

00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:09.720
because these are just some
little observations I've made

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:11.196
based on a handful of anecdotes.

00:17:11.196 --> 00:17:13.069
And as rational males

00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:16.050
it's important that we consider the facts,

00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:18.080
the stats, and the figures.

00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:20.843
Did you know that 46% of men

00:17:20.843 --> 00:17:25.843
are at least 2.8 times
different than 73% of women?

00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:27.213
Look it up.

00:17:27.213 --> 00:17:28.450
I haven't.

00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:30.880
I guess my super f*cking Libra opinion

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:32.471
is that there's upsides and downsides

00:17:32.471 --> 00:17:34.370
to male and female experience.

00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:36.710
I don't actually think there's
a single definite answer

00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:38.176
to the vague and useless question,

00:17:38.176 --> 00:17:40.330
"Which gender has it worse?"

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:41.730
I consider myself a feminist

00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:43.740
because I support reproductive rights

00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:45.590
and I oppose workplace misogyny

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:48.120
and I generally agree
with a lot of the activism

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:50.240
that happens under the
heading of feminism.

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:52.280
But I also think a lot of men are just

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:54.197
having a super f*cking
difficult time right now

00:17:54.197 --> 00:17:57.400
and that must be super
f*cking hard for them heyhowreyou.

00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:59.410
And I don't think feminists
have an obligation

00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:03.570
to care about male angst,
but I care about you boys.

00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:04.863
God, I'm such a cool girl,

00:18:04.863 --> 00:18:06.670
️ I think the entire mid-Atlantic region

00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:07.930
is about to freeze over.

00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:10.510
No, I'm just a super f*cking
empathetic Pisces moon,

00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:12.560
and I really try to understand

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:14.180
other people's pain because

00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:18.376
I just find it really, really funny.

00:18:18.376 --> 00:18:21.690
I'm also really, really sobering up here.

00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:23.140
The drugs have worn off,

00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:26.220
and I am suddenly feeling

00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:27.490
very naked.

00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:29.160
Like it's just now occurring to me

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:32.190
that this is a highly inappropriate outfit

00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:33.400
for this occasion.

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:35.890
So, I'm gonna go put on a robe,

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:38.635
and I'll meet you back
for the next section.

00:18:38.635 --> 00:18:41.973
Postulate three, The Man Question.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.667
(upbeat music)

00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:49.985
Hi boys, et cetera, et cetera.

00:18:49.985 --> 00:18:51.490
Heyhowareyou?

00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:53.290
For the last three years on this channel

00:18:53.290 --> 00:18:57.520
I have been your Virgil,
leading you through gender hell.

00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:00.720
Pick-up artists, gender dysphoria, incels,

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:03.560
radical feminists, non-binary genders,

00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:04.930
men's rights activists.

00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:08.150
It seems like everybody's
having gender trouble.

00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:09.550
So what do we make of that?

00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:13.560
Well gorg, a very, very
rational male philosopher

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:14.906
named Hegel once said

00:19:14.906 --> 00:19:17.360
that the unfolding of history

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:20.080
is a basically rational process, gorg.

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:22.400
That means that at any time in history,

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:25.430
society is based on
certain principles, like

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:28.140
all men are created equal

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:30.170
as long as they're super
f*cking white and rich.

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:33.100
And there's always contradictions
within those principles,

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:36.350
which creates tension and
eventually leads to a rupture,

00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:38.490
like a revolution, where society has

00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:40.980
to be reorganized according
to new principles.

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:43.130
At least, I think he was
saying something like that.

00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:44.610
It's pretty hard to make anything out

00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:46.250
through the fog of his unreadable,

00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:48.110
hyper-abstract man-jabbering.

00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:49.588
God, I can't stand that shit

00:19:49.588 --> 00:19:52.050
or any of the other music-hating volcels

00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:53.960
of the male philosophical tradition.

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:56.510
My point is I think our
society has reached a place

00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:59.660
where gender as we know it
just isn't working anymore.

00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:01.740
Now no one seems to agree
why it isn't working

00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:02.940
or how to fix it,

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:05.170
but we do all agree that it's broken.

00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:07.040
We have mainstream
feminists saying we need

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:08.539
to continue advancing the rights of women.

00:20:08.539 --> 00:20:10.170
We have conservatives saying

00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:12.620
we need restore the
gender roles of the 1950s.

00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:14.170
We have an increasing number of people

00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:16.140
not identifying as men or women.

00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:18.410
We have TERFs who think
that the transgenders

00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:21.180
are the single greatest
threat to civilization, heyhowareyou?

00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:22.795
And we have men's rights
activists saying we need

00:20:22.795 --> 00:20:24.568
a male equivalent to feminism

00:20:24.568 --> 00:20:27.850
to liberate men from their
oppressive gender role.

00:20:27.850 --> 00:20:29.560
Now I wanna focus on that last one

00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:32.700
because in principle I agree.

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:34.330
I've spent a lot of the last three years

00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:35.640
covering the manosphere.

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:37.050
I know, such a feminine topic.

00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:38.050
Love that for me.

00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:40.040
And from all the time I've tortured myself

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:41.747
wading through these
communities of incels,

00:20:41.747 --> 00:20:44.830
pick-up artists, men's
rights slacktivists,

00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:46.630
intellectual dark web fanboys,

00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:49.400
and alt-right racists, I've noticed

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:51.340
that they all have one thing in common,

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:52.580
which is that they all recruit

00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:56.600
from the same massive
pool of sad young men.

00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:57.950
We all know the archetype.

00:20:57.950 --> 00:20:59.349
He has trouble relating to women.

00:20:59.349 --> 00:21:01.210
He has no strong friendship group.

00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:03.132
He's not excited about
any long-term goals,

00:21:03.132 --> 00:21:06.160
and he fills the void
with video games and porn.

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:08.740
And just to clarify, I'm
not trying to take away

00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:10.050
your video games and porn.

00:21:10.050 --> 00:21:11.810
I'm not telling what
to do with your penis.

00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:14.040
You can rub one out to
this video for all I care.

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:16.104
Just don't pull a Gamergate on me, okay?

00:21:16.104 --> 00:21:17.800
(sighs)

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:19.060
I live in fear.

00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:20.350
Look, I like to believe

00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:22.527
that until the red-pillers
inject their poison,

00:21:22.527 --> 00:21:25.004
most of these boys are not bad people.

00:21:25.004 --> 00:21:26.371
I think this all originates

00:21:26.371 --> 00:21:29.120
in a genuine crisis of male identity.

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:30.970
And I think it's happened in something

00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:33.340
like the way men's rights
activists describe.

00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:35.513
The sacrificial role of men as warriors

00:21:35.513 --> 00:21:37.950
is no longer widely
glorified or necessary.

00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:40.350
The traditional
protector/provider role of men

00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:42.860
is being replaced by a more equal

00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:44.332
and undefined gender dynamic.

00:21:44.332 --> 00:21:47.320
And college professors and
activists are telling men

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:50.280
that most of our culture's
aspirational representations

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:52.370
of manhood are toxic and bad.

00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:54.450
But without an attractive
replacement vision

00:21:54.450 --> 00:21:56.165
of aspirational manhood,

00:21:56.165 --> 00:22:00.507
average young men can only
imagine their future as... what?

00:22:00.507 --> 00:22:01.806
The beta.

00:22:01.806 --> 00:22:03.017
The cuck.

00:22:03.017 --> 00:22:04.322
The nu male.

00:22:04.322 --> 00:22:06.390
And in a post-LeftTube internet,

00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:08.307
we're so used to laughing
at this vocabulary,

00:22:08.307 --> 00:22:11.590
and to be fair it is very funny,

00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:13.474
but we forget, especially us grills,

00:22:13.474 --> 00:22:15.510
that for a lot of men
these words actually do

00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:18.820
tap into a deep, existential angst.

00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:19.988
And a lot of leftists go,

00:22:19.988 --> 00:22:23.620
"Well how can men be so
angsty, especially white men?

00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:24.535
"They're so privileged."

00:22:24.535 --> 00:22:28.730
But existential angst is
often a disease of privilege.

00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:31.750
If you're actually being
oppressed you have a struggle.

00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:33.290
You have something to fight for,

00:22:33.290 --> 00:22:35.230
and therefore a purpose.

00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:37.730
But for a lot men their lack of purpose

00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:40.010
puts them in search of a struggle.

00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:42.330
And that, along with the loneliness

00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:44.430
and the lack of a positive identity

00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:46.680
is what makes men
vulnerable to recruitment

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:49.060
by the manosphere groups
and by the alt-right.

00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:52.010
And even worse, it seems
to be a motivating factor

00:22:52.010 --> 00:22:54.154
for the small but growing
number of young men

00:22:54.154 --> 00:22:55.862
who decide to pick up a gun

00:22:55.862 --> 00:22:58.340
and open fire in a shopping center.

00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:00.240
There were two mass
shootings during the weekend

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:03.540
I was writing this video,
resulting in 31 deaths.

00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:04.818
Both shooters were young white men,

00:23:04.818 --> 00:23:07.440
and one of them posted about the shooting

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:08.810
on an alt-right image board.

00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:10.220
Now I don't pretend to fully understand

00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:11.750
the motives of mass shooters,

00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:13.610
but I don't think it's a coincidence

00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:15.540
that basically all of them are men.

00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:18.229
One possible interpretation
of the mass shooting epidemic

00:23:18.229 --> 00:23:20.916
is that these killers
are trying to resurrect

00:23:20.916 --> 00:23:24.430
some horrible parody of
ancient masculine glory

00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:28.310
and therefore to be seen
and recognized as men

00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:31.880
by unleashing Homeric
violence in a f*cking Walmart.

00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:33.610
And of course there's also the racism

00:23:33.610 --> 00:23:34.960
of the alt-right killers

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:37.960
and the wounded sexual
entitlement of the incel killers.

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:41.231
But that racism and that
sexual entitlement are learned,

00:23:41.231 --> 00:23:43.611
and men in the throes
of a masculinity crisis

00:23:43.611 --> 00:23:45.565
are much more receptive to learning it.

00:23:45.565 --> 00:23:48.069
So you can try to take down their forums

00:23:48.069 --> 00:23:50.878
and ban their accounts and
deplatform their events,

00:23:50.878 --> 00:23:54.325
but as long as this male
identity crisis goes on,

00:23:54.325 --> 00:23:57.589
I don't see any end to these problems.

00:23:57.589 --> 00:24:00.360
Theorem four, What Do?

00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:02.410
There's this media narrative

00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:05.140
that has emerged around me
and around this channel.

00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:06.190
And by the way, the fact

00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:08.662
that there's any kind media
narrative about this channel

00:24:08.662 --> 00:24:11.070
is super f*cking coconuts.

00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:12.455
Because let's be real gorg,

00:24:12.455 --> 00:24:14.577
I just wanted to pour milk on my face

00:24:14.577 --> 00:24:16.310
and talk about the mouthfeel.

00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:17.660
But there's this media narrative

00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:19.104
that my role in the discourse is

00:24:19.104 --> 00:24:21.600
"de-radicalizing

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:22.433
"young

00:24:22.433 --> 00:24:24.630
"alt-right men."

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:26.240
And it's true that if you read

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:28.224
the leftist YouTube fan subreddits,

00:24:28.224 --> 00:24:30.920
I used to be alt-right posts are so common

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:32.177
they're considered cliché.

00:24:32.177 --> 00:24:34.740
And some of them cite me as an influence

00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:35.990
in changing their politics,

00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:39.760
which I love for them and I'm
super f*cking happy about it,

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:43.610
but it's also a lot of responsibility.

00:24:43.610 --> 00:24:45.490
They're (Grindr notification) my boys.

00:24:45.490 --> 00:24:48.140
And I worry about (Grindr
notification) my boys.

00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:49.820
Because in reality it's not like

00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:52.820
they go from far-right extremists
to complacent centrists.

00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:53.653
No.

00:24:53.653 --> 00:24:54.673
Most of them go far left.

00:24:54.673 --> 00:24:57.256
A lot of times they become
communists or anarchists.

00:24:57.256 --> 00:24:59.710
So I watch them go from far to my right

00:24:59.710 --> 00:25:01.780
to significantly to my left.

00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:04.920
It's not really de-radicalizing
so much as re-radicalizing.

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:06.910
And I think it's
definitely an improvement,

00:25:06.910 --> 00:25:09.520
but I still worry it's
not gonna be good enough.

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:11.940
I worry about (Grindr
notification) my boys.

00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:13.850
Because I don't think
that the left yet has

00:25:13.850 --> 00:25:16.550
a final solution to the man question.

00:25:16.550 --> 00:25:17.383
Oh no.

00:25:17.383 --> 00:25:18.657
That was worded poorly.

00:25:18.657 --> 00:25:20.470
You know, there's kind of two options

00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:22.360
the left has for disillusioned men.

00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:25.780
The first is the Marxist
promise of economic revolution.

00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:28.630
We say, "Well, actually
yes, you are oppressed.

00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:31.610
"But you're oppressed because
of your class, not your gender.

00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:32.870
"So just join the revolution.

00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:34.478
"It's gonna be super f*cking crazy.

00:25:34.478 --> 00:25:36.351
"We're gonna overthrow the bourgeoisie,

00:25:36.351 --> 00:25:37.370
"meow meow,

00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:41.161
"smash no voting, and then
things will be better for you."

00:25:41.161 --> 00:25:43.635
Now, I think that has
a couple limitations.

00:25:43.635 --> 00:25:46.310
One is that I look at the far left

00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:48.620
and I see a bunch of people

00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:50.338
who spend all their
time accusing each other

00:25:50.338 --> 00:25:53.710
of abusing moderator privileges
in closed Facebook groups.

00:25:53.710 --> 00:25:55.610
And I'm concerned

00:25:55.610 --> 00:25:57.730
that might not succeed

00:25:57.730 --> 00:25:59.390
at ending capitalism.

00:25:59.390 --> 00:26:00.223
Meow meow

00:26:00.223 --> 00:26:01.960
Like, definitely vote for Bernie Sanders

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:03.470
or Elizabeth Warren or whoever,

00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:06.100
but if you're investing all of your hopes

00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:07.857
in a capital R Revolution,

00:26:07.857 --> 00:26:10.616
I worry that can become
like waiting for Godot

00:26:10.616 --> 00:26:12.520
or waiting for the rapture.

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:14.160
So we do need political change,

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:17.070
but I feel like I'm failing

00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:18.090
(Grindr notification) my boys

00:26:18.090 --> 00:26:19.720
if I'm somehow giving them the idea

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:21.601
that revolution is their only hope.

00:26:21.601 --> 00:26:23.220
Cause here's the other thing.

00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:25.920
Even if we did succeed
at ending capitalism,

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:27.140
there would still be gender,

00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:30.270
and (Grindr notification) my
boys would still need some model

00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:33.136
of what it is to lead
a good life as a man.

00:26:33.136 --> 00:26:35.570
Now the other option the left
has for disillusioned men

00:26:35.570 --> 00:26:38.330
is the feminist tranquilizer.

00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:41.110
We say, "Look, toxic
masculinity is the reason

00:26:41.110 --> 00:26:42.678
"you don't have room to
express your feelings,

00:26:42.678 --> 00:26:45.370
"and it's the reason you
feel lonely and inadequate."

00:26:45.370 --> 00:26:47.740
So, while feminism tells
women, "You hate your body

00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:49.270
"and you're constantly doubting yourself

00:26:49.270 --> 00:26:52.950
"because society did this
to you and needs to change,"

00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:55.820
we kinda just tell men,
"You're lonely and suicidal

00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:56.850
"because you're toxic.

00:26:56.850 --> 00:26:57.760
"Stop it."

00:26:57.760 --> 00:26:59.020
We tell them that they're broken

00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:01.710
without really telling
them how to fix themselves.

00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:06.200
I think what men need is a
new, positive ideal of manhood,

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:07.300
which I don't think is something

00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:10.420
that women cannot create for
men, even if they wanted to.

00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:12.360
And honestly the best
way for that to happen

00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:14.620
may actually be some
kind of men's movement.

00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:17.270
But on the left the whole
idea of a men's movement

00:27:17.270 --> 00:27:20.900
is basically taboo because
the men's movement we all know

00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:23.150
is basically just a backlash to feminism,

00:27:23.150 --> 00:27:26.022
and at worst, it's just
straight-up misogyny.

00:27:26.022 --> 00:27:28.860
And look boys, I understand
that being lectured

00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:30.500
about manspreading for most of 2015

00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:32.900
was super fucking hard for you

00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:34.004
and you're still mad about it,

00:27:34.004 --> 00:27:36.850
but posting endless outrage p*rn

00:27:36.850 --> 00:27:38.837
about false r*pe accusations
and paternity fraud

00:27:38.837 --> 00:27:42.179
isn't actually gonna make
life any better for you.

00:27:42.179 --> 00:27:45.441
Because yes, those things are
horrible when they happen,

00:27:45.441 --> 00:27:49.040
but they're not systemic
issues that affect most men.

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:52.370
I think what would actually
improve life for most men

00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:55.860
is a positive ideal of
21st century manhood,

00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:58.700
but that's not something I can give to you

00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:00.248
because in case you hadn't noticed

00:28:00.248 --> 00:28:02.733
I'm literally a fu*cking woman.

00:28:02.733 --> 00:28:04.600
I can't mom you through this one boys.

00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:05.710
You're on your own.

00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:07.200
You have to help each other.

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:09.610
So find each other in
the comments section.

00:28:09.610 --> 00:28:10.810
Meet up on Reddit.

00:28:10.810 --> 00:28:11.643
Make friends.

00:28:11.643 --> 00:28:12.580
Clean your room.

00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:13.413
Leave the house.

00:28:13.413 --> 00:28:14.502
F*ck each other.
(Grindr notification)

00:28:14.502 --> 00:28:15.810
I don't know.

00:28:15.810 --> 00:28:16.672
It's worth a try.

00:28:16.672 --> 00:28:18.113
And failing that,

00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:23.078
you could always throw in
the towel and become a woman.

00:28:23.078 --> 00:28:24.587
Worked for me!

00:28:24.587 --> 00:28:27.170
(upbeat music)

00:29:20.994 --> 00:29:23.063
- I'm just trying to
give like m'lady energy.

00:29:23.063 --> 00:29:23.896
- Yeah, it is.

00:29:23.896 --> 00:29:24.729
It is English.

00:29:24.729 --> 00:29:25.580
It's very John Maclean.

00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:28.700
Very Quentin Crisp, very aristocrat.

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:30.050
I'm super f*cking naked right now.

00:29:30.050 --> 00:29:31.290
That's crazy.

00:29:31.290 --> 00:29:32.910
That's super f*cking crazy.

00:29:32.910 --> 00:29:35.022
According to traditional gender roles,

00:29:35.022 --> 00:29:37.020
men are useful for their labor

00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:39.250
and women are useful for their wombs.

00:29:39.250 --> 00:29:42.760
Well, I'm a woman without a
womb so I guess I'm useless.

00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:43.761
But I'm beautifully useless.

00:29:43.761 --> 00:29:44.780
Agh!

00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:45.845
I'm a work of art!

00:29:45.845 --> 00:29:47.670
The problem with our society

00:29:47.670 --> 00:29:49.047
is we've turned men into women.

00:29:49.047 --> 00:29:50.424
It's disgusting.

00:29:50.424 --> 00:29:53.920
As an ally to men, it's not my place

00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:56.310
to speak for them or speak over them,

00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:58.910
but I just want to use my platform

00:29:58.910 --> 00:30:01.810
to uplift some male voices

00:30:01.810 --> 00:30:06.523
who might not have as
many subscribers as me.

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:13.111
I'm not hypergamous.

00:30:13.111 --> 00:30:14.513
I don't need a rich husband.

00:30:14.513 --> 00:30:16.266
If I may quote Cher,

00:30:16.266 --> 00:30:18.820
"I don't need a rich man.

00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:19.999
"I am a rich man."

00:30:19.999 --> 00:30:21.492
It's not even much of an insult

00:30:21.492 --> 00:30:23.550
being called a delusional man.

00:30:23.550 --> 00:30:26.277
Many great books have been
written by delusional men.

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:30.120
So bad.

00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:31.003
I'm bad.

00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:33.911
I'm really bad.

00:30:33.911 --> 00:30:34.753
Okay.
